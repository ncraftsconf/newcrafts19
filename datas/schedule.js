                        "description": "The design patterns from Domain-Driven Design are gradually entering the collective consciousness of software developers. But most of the information out there focuses on mechanistic implementation details of the patterns: how to make an Entity in [insert favourite programming language], how to use the Repository pattern with [insert new hot ORM], how to make immutable Value Objects in [insert legacy framework]...\n\nApplied individually, these patterns are useful, but are not giving you the full potential of Domain-Driven Design.\n\nThis one day training has a different approach. We address technical concerns in implementing the DDD patterns, but the focus is on the underlying principles and heuristics for building great domain-centric object-oriented code.\n\n- Why you’re underusing Value Objects\n- Seeing objects as containers of lifecycles and consistency\n* Discovering deeper domain concepts such as business rules, and lifting them into first class domain objects\n- The relevance of processes, behaviour, temporal modelling... for finding better Aggregate boundaries\n- How mutable software designs have distorted our perception of mutability in the domain\n- Better heuristics for understanding a complex domain, and using them to drive a more focused design\n- Reducing our dependance on service classes\n- Designing an implementation model that not only encapsulates the domain, but communicates that design to future programmers and reduces their surface area for bugs\n- ...\n\nThis workshop, aimed at programmers, is designed to give you immediate benefits when modelling and implementing the most important parts of your codebase.",

                        "description": "Creating multiple models for the same problem is one of the more important lessons that Domain Driven Design teaches us. It is a lot cheaper to quickly iterate over them and throw away less useful prototypes before we even start coding. However, creating multiple models can be hard. When we begin gaining insight from our domain, we suffer a lot from cognitive biases that get in our way to gain new insights. We need these insights before we even start thinking about modelling. Tools like event storming and example mapping can help us to deliberate discover, and battle these biases. They help you quickly gain insight into the problem space. But the fallacy here is that we can get locked into the tool, and get stuck again.\n\n**What you will learn**  \nIn this workshop, you will learn the essentials of event storming and how it can help you gain the necessary insights you need to deliver quality software. With our newly acquired domain knowledge, we can then start exploring the solution space. During the exploration, we begin to design and model multiple models for the same problem with Domain Driven Design patterns. This way of visualising gives us the power to quickly iterate over the different models and figure out which model will be the best to use for now. Eventually, we start our coding journey TDD style, iterating over the model to refactor towards deeper insights while discovering how hexagonal architecture may help us to protect our domain code from the technical concerns, in the long run.  \n\n**Target Audience**  \nThis workshop is for you if you are a software architect or software developer.",

What does it mean for existing code that looks more like the mutant apocalypse than an elegant application of mathematical thinking?\n\nImmutability can be an ideal that is hard to reach. Refactoring, on the other hand, is all about the art of the possible. In this hands-on workshop, we'll be looking at some tricks and tips to help reduce the mutability of code.\n\nSo bring a laptop, but don't worry about IDEs, editors, compilers and all that — just browser and WiFi! We'll be running the hands-on part using cyber-dojo.org, working with unit tests, promiscuous pairing and good humour :-)",

Radical innovations using state of the art technology in the 1500s brought us the ancestor of the modern violin and even classical artists such as Stravinsky and Debussy were considered avant guard in their time. This talk will explore some of the most radical and exciting music technologies and sound hacking artists of the modern age.\n\nHelen Leigh is a creative technologist specialising in sound who works in Berlin and London, home to some of the most interesting music technologies and sound artists in the world. She will take you on a whistle stop tour of several strange and beautiful creations made by herself and members of the communities she belongs to, including gesture controlled musical instruments, a pipe organ made of Furbies and live coding rave culture. You’ll be able to hear what a cello sounds like after you’ve bounced the sound off the moon and watch a live performance of a pair of singing capacitive touch circuit sculptures.\n\nWhich technologies will change our musical landscapes in the future and which will become forgotten curiosities?",

However, functional programming comes with interesting tools aimed at solving these boring (or deemed boring) concerns: dependency inversion, observability). Aspect-Oriented-Programming is often used for this in the OO word. \n\nA functional solution, called a _monad stack_, allows to combine all this cross-cutting concerns and behaviours with no magic (or not too much). \n\nIn this conference, we'll see what _monad transformers_ are, how they work, and how to use them to structure a web application, with examples in scala and haskell.",

Too often, it neglected by teams and left to the end for penetration testers to consider. But, it doesn't have to be. Security can be considered early in the development cycle. How can we encourage this behaviour? How can you get development teams interested?\n\nSecurity is an important skill to possess while delivering quality software. The cost of not having security skills within teams is now more obvious than ever. Security should be in the forefront of development teams minds. Even with these risks, data leaks and denial of service attacks are in the headlines often. How do we stop our companies being another statistic?\n\nLearning should not be compulsory. Especially if you want something to become part of the culture. Beginning with a simple workshop to expanding to a security guild, people were eager to be involved. This lead to further workshops which included the basics of threat modelling using STRIDE to the complexity of automated checks. Security at Sky became not only fun but cool.

For a love-in or a development role? _Passion_ is used to evoke single-mindedness, drive and intensity, but it also has many other meanings, surely not all of which can be intended. Love aside, passion also spills over into irrationality, aggression — e.g., crimes of passion — and unconditional and unquestioning pursuit of ideas. Our acceptance of this word and this quality should be partial and conditional. But there is more than one kind of passion, and when raw passion is tempered with compassion and dispassion we start to see a more balanced way of development.\n\nGood development draws on both creativity and rationality, on both experience and experimentation, on both focus and connection, on both individual skill and group intelligence. The dry language of productivity needs to admit the possibility of enjoyment; the culture of burn-out needs to give way to humanity and empathy. Let's explore the many passions of programming.",

                            "description": "How should you actually implement Continuous Delivery?\n\nAdopting Continuous Delivery takes time. You have a long list of technology and organisational changes to consider. You have to work within the unique circumstances of your organisation. You’re constantly surrounded by strange problems, half-baked theories, off the shelf solutions that just don’t work, and people telling you they’ve worked here for 23 years and Amazon is nothing to worry about.\n\nHow do you identify and remove the major impediments in your build, testing, and operational activities? How do you avoid spending weeks, months, or years on far-reaching changes that ultimately have no impact on your time to market?\n\nThe Theory of Constraints is a management paradigm that describes how to improve throughput in a homogeneous workflow. It can be applied to Continuous Delivery in order to locate, prioritise, and reduceconstrained activities until a flow of release candidates to production is achieved.\n\nIn this talk, Steve Smith will explain how easy it is for a Continuous Delivery programme to be unsuccessful, how the Theory Of Constraints works, how to apply the Five Focussing Steps to Continuous Delivery, and how to home in on the constrained activities that are your keys to success. It includes tales of glorious failures and ignominious successes when adopting Continuous Delivery.",

If we assume boundaries in the wrong place, or forget or omit important aspects of communication, we can end up with brittle services, performance issues, and needlessly coupled modules and components, which are painful to maintain and deploy.\nSome of those aspects are hard to discover upfront, and even with great experience, it's not unusual to get the first design at least partially wrong. \n\nOne way to minimize the consequences of those decisions, and to verify our initial assumptions, is to start implementation not with a full architecture in mind, but rather with the smallest possible footprint: A plain, but fully operational prototype of the domain model, which we can stress, observe and explore - and change easily, if we run into problems. This way, we can actually _see_ our design work, and gain valuable insights.\n\nUsing examples, I will demonstrate how combining Domain Driven Design with the practices, heuristics and principles of Software Crafting can highlight difficult or problematic choices, improve fundamental architecture decisions, and ultimately lead to better and more sustainable software systems, long before we get sidetracked by the additional complexity of host environments and deployment pipelines.",

However, I've never talked about how to actually build a system based on this architecture style. I keep getting the same questions over and over again. Like when to apply Event Sourcing and at what architectural level. How to deal with transactional boundaries within and outside the domain. How to build projections that are autonomous, reliable and self-supporting. How to deal with upgrades and blue-green deployments. But also on how to handle bugs, design mistakes and crashing projections. Having made a lot of these mistakes myself over these years, it's time to share my current thoughts and opinions about this. Since the .NET space has a pretty rich set of open-source projections to support this, the examples and code will be .NET. But the concepts are universal, so don't let that scare you off.",

Were there more choices than we realised? Did we focus on the right thing? Did we pick the right option? Are there other methods we can use to reach a better outcome?\nIf we improved our decision making by just 1%, overall we would achieve a massive improvement in every area of our lives, from happiness with our family to success at work. Everybody should learn decision making heuristics, yet nobody does. Let’s fix that.\n\nWe’re going to take a close look at a variety of key decision-making heuristics including \"problem restatement\", \"devil’s advocate\", and \"the wizard\". Through provocative exercises, we’re going to uncover the heuristics we currently use and we’re going to teach ourselves when to apply certain decision making heuristics to improve our chances of getting the results we want.",

In each round you'll be limited in such a way that you'll have to get creative and come up with vastly different models for the same problem space. At the end you'll see what the power is of an enabling constraint.

The difficulty of testing the untestable code of our legacy codebase so that it can be refactored into something where it is easy to add functionality using TDD.\n\nBut how is this done when I have no separation of layers, no architecture and I can't even mock the database? Well let's see the workflow through a live demonstration of how tests are put in place, how the code is refactored and then finally how tests are separated into different layers of the testing pyramid, and finally how easy it becomes to TDD the new feature!\n\nThis demonstrates not only the basic workflow of modern development with legacy code, but also how we can leverage preparatory refactoring to gain time even in the short term, thanks to testing. Additionally it illustrates how respecting the testing pyramid makes a developers life more pleasant.\n\nCode that makes no sense to unit test due to bad design is a common problem. This small example models this problem in realistic way due to its hard-coded integration with external dependencies that cannot be \"stubbed out\".",

In this talk, we'll look at four languages designed over forty years ago -- SQL, Prolog, ML, and Smalltalk -- and discuss their philosophy and approach to programming, which is very different from most popular languages today. We'll come away with some practical design principles that are still applicable to modern development.",

A world, for example, where we can tell whether someone is going to a commit crime before they do. A lot of our problems would just disappear. The quest for absolute certainty has been at the top of Western science’s agenda. In a similar fashion, current technological developments tend to strive for generalizability and predictability. We value certainty, stability and uniformity. Whereas most of reality, instead of being orderly and stable is seething with change, disorder and process. People, far from being predictable and predetermined, are complex, social and dynamical beings that inherently exist in a web of relations. This talk discusses how absolute certainty is not only an unattainable goal so far as understanding people and the social world is concerned but also a dangerous state to aspire to.",

The halting problem will still be undecidable and appending to the end of a linked list will still have O(n) complexity. Finding similar fundamental ideas about software engineering is much harder. We will still have some development methodology, but it will likely differ from Waterfall or Agile. We will likely have some modelling tools, but they will likely not be based on UML, DDD or event sourcing. Are there any fundamental ideas about software engineering, or do we just keep re-inventing the wheel?\n\n\nI believe that fundamental principles of software engineering are of a very different kind than fundamental principles in theoretical computer science. Rather than alluding to mathematics, we need to critically reflect on the history. In this talk, we will look at past development methodologies, debates in the field and important milestones such as the 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering. I hope to convince you that critical reflection on those is a fundamental kind of knowledge about software engineering that will make you a better software engineer or craftsman and that will also be as relevant in 100 years as it is today.",

Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from _Netflix and Chill_ to _Fitbit and Move_ to _Twitter and Rage_—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.",

We have a pretty good understanding of how to improve our code from a technical perspective, but how can we increase the effectiveness of the team creating that code and designs? In the end, software is a technical activity, created by human beings, so it’s crucial to understand the underlying social dynamics that affect our code and designs.\n\nWe should especially try to understand the social heuristics that we are using continuously to make sense of the world. In this talk, Evelyn van Kelle will discuss why we need a shared sense of reality and how this relates to team structure and the quality of your products. Second, she will explore two famous perspectives on sensemaking, and relate them to three social heuristics that are heavily affecting our products and decisions. \n\n- What you see is all there is (availability heuristic)\n- Beware of the experts (related to overconfidence)\n- The curse of first impressions (related to anchoring)\n\nThese heuristics have everything to do with tackling complexity at the heart of software development. In fact, they offer us ways to deal with the complexity we’re facing on a daily basis. If we know the domain, or ‘world’ that we’re operating in, and we are aware of heuristics that may affect our work, we can safely celebrate heuristics and make the best decisions of our lives. ",

After all, isn't that the promise of Domain Driven Design?\n\nBusiness policies are crucial and for us tech people, so is the right way to model them. We want our code to be extensible and to keep up with the changes in business. Time is also a crucial element in modeling business workflows and is implemented in a multitude of ways like timers, scheduled jobs, etc. In this talk, we'll discuss the saga message pattern to see how you can model complex business workflows, and model time as an immutable durable event so you can implement your business policies in such a manner that it truly evolves around your business.

A system is a group of interacting, interrelated or interdependent parts unified to have a purpose. Examples can be a heating system, a tree, a human, a social system, an IT system, and IT Teams working as a part in a company which is also again a system.\n\nFor me, the most interesting part of the book is about system traps. They are traps in where systems can go wrong without noticing. Since reading the book I started observing these traps in my day to day work. Traps like seeking the wrong goal with a code coverage threshold, shifting the burden to an intervener by letting a separate QA team be responsible for quality. Join me in this talk where I will go into more of these system traps I observed in IT teams, and what I did to get out of these traps. ",

Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from _Netflix and Chill_ to _Fitbit and Move_ to _Twitter and Rage_—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.",

Any time we “check whether something works”, “test the bug fix” or “perform tests for a new feature”, we can (and should) use exploratory testing techniques.\n\nEven though the technique is so important, it is still misunderstood. It’s thought to be “clicking around” or “unstructured testing”. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate and explain what exploratory testing is and will also provide participants with reasons why they should be using it in their teams. We’ll provide analogies to other work we do in development teams (like debugging or identifying error causes) and look at how exploratory testing can be used beyond the UI.\n\nTo round off, we’ll give hints about where, how and when to use it in your process, be it agile or traditional or a mix of both.",

Traditional modelling styles, focused on things and structures, are not the primary way anymore to build modern systems that handle complexity well. Entity-centric designs tend to have an uneasy relation with events happening over time. The actual business processes, the heart of how organisations operate, end up hidden in the many calls between services.\n\nTemporal Modelling is the cure: build models and systems that make events and processes the first class building blocks of a domain model. In this talk, we’re going to look at how reasoning with time helps us better understand how to build our software.",

How do we do that when empowered/Agile/DevOps teams make many choices independently? In this talk you will learn about a coaching technique for building up people, skills and teams.\n\nIn a DevOps world of Agile empowered teams, exerting technical leadership across an organization is challenging. When I was a junior to mid-level developer, the technical leaders in my organization were called Architects. Day to day, I saw little of them. The help they gave me comprised mainly of architectural diagrams to guide development work, and compulsory standard tools and frameworks. Occasionally they would hold workshops with the whole team and go through important technical decisions. These people, although once skilled programmers, did not write code themselves any more.\n\nMore recently, I've found DevOps to be a great way to get teams aligned with sensible shared goals, and to ensure they there is enough automation so there is time available for the important work of developing new features. I'm seeing a lot of people migrating to a microservices architecture, and gaining advantage from smaller, more manageable codebases. This is all good stuff. My biggest concerns now that I am a more senior developer and technical leader, is how to ensure the code produced is of good quality, has automated tests, and follows broad architectural guidelines. These concerns are similar to those of the past, but in my opinion the kind of technical leader we need today looks a lot more like a coach than a traditional architect.\n\nLately I have been using a coaching method that was originally developed by Llewellyn Falco. It involves first teaching each development team how to do mob programming. This is combined with a short daily training class teaching agile development techniques. Once each team has learnt mob programming, you can use this forum to coach them in their codebase. It's the most effective way I have found so far to teach a skill like Test-Driven Development. I believe you can also use this coaching method to encourage consistent use of other coding techniques, libraries and frameworks.\n\nIn this talk you will learn what Mob Programming is, what it is good for, and how I am using it. I hope hearing about my experiences will help you to add this coaching technique to your arsenal as a technical leader in a modern, Agile, DevOps organization.",

Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from _Netflix and Chill_ to _Fitbit and Move_ to _Twitter and Rage_—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.",

So I looked into how I could contribute to open source projects that I use myself.\nAfter contributing for almost two years, I notice that I have learned a lot from my contributions (which has been useful at work), as well as have made friends and have become part of a community. \n\nIn this talk I will share my experience with contributing to Cucumber, including an early mistake (merging something that wasn't ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core contributors, and still feeling welcome!\nYou'll learn how how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful and the many types of contributions you can make. \n\nContributing to open source is a way of paying back to the community. In addition, it is a way for you to learn, collaborate and become part of a community. Getting (constructive) feedback on a pull request and collaborating to make things even better is a great feeling!",

And people could pick what they work on?\n\nIs it a recipe for disaster? Or would it give you the flexibility to work on what has the highest business impact, increase engagement and develop your future leaders? What are the tradeoffs? How do you balance short term impact with long term ownership and platform stability?\n\nIn this talk, I'll tell you how I initially led a team of ~20 people from a static structure to something a lot more dynamic where reteaming happens quarterly, and how we are now scaling those practices to 60 people. I'll share with you:\n- How we plan our quarters and let people pick what they work on\n- How we create constraints to make sure the important work gets done while developing knowledge sharing\n- How we use OKRs to create alignment and track progress\n- How we keep in sync and engage with our stakeholders\n- How lead time is decreasing as a result\n\nI'll also share details on our journey: our mistakes, our learnings, what we still struggle with 1 year later and why we think this is strongly aligned with Agile core values!",

Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from _Netflix and Chill_ to _Fitbit and Move_ to _Twitter and Rage_—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.",

The only reason for us to build technology is to serve humans.\n\nTherefore, practicing compassion is essential for effective software development. Though many people think of compassion as something soft or ambiguous, you'll learn how compassion provides a practical framework for making rational decisions about our code with the goal of reducing suffering for ourselves, our collaborators, and our users.\n\nFrom understanding customer pain points all the way down to the level of choosing variable names, applying practical compassion can help us craft better code, improve people's lives, and ultimately find more satisfaction in our work!",

We say we depend on estimates to make important decisions, and yet we’re often disappointed by the results.\nWhy are we so challenged at estimation?  Are estimates for cost, time, or effort always needed? Is it possible there are other ways to approach our work?  If we didn’t estimate, how could we still be successful at making business decisions?\nThere are a number of things to explore and many questions to ask. For example, do we really need estimates for all the things we are currently using them? Are we getting a reasonable benefit from them? Is it possible to manage software development projects without these estimates, or at least with fewer estimates?  Is there a way to prove that estimates are helping us make good decisions?\nIn this session we’ll participate in some interactive information gathering exercises to see if we can gain a shared idea of our current understanding of the purpose and use of estimates.\nWe will examine the nature of software development. Our exploration goal is to see if we can work together to come up with some ideas about eliminating or improving on the traditional approaches to using estimates.",

Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from _Netflix and Chill_ to _Fitbit and Move_ to _Twitter and Rage_—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.",
